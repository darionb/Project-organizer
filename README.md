# Project-organizer
The purpose of this platform is to organize company project data in such a way that it can be accessed by multiple people with a username and password.

## High Level data oranization
This code will need to include a project lookup. Under each project the following information will be stored: 

### Contacts
This will be a section in the code where users can input all information about a contact (First name, last name, email address, address, phone number). A  dropdown menu for what kind of contact it is. Once a contact is inputted, it needs to be automatically stored in a general contact list that lists all contacts per each project
### Project procurement details
This will need to include what vendors have been contacted, a spot for document upload where the quotes from each distributor/ supplier can be found. If possible, I would like to create a cost comparison that pulls the data from each bid and is able to analyze the data to dictate the lowest cost per item. 
### Utility phases
This will need to be able to list the status of the utility phase. When a user inputs the project, the utility phase status will appear. This will only be able to be edited by me. PDF document upload is needed.  
### Engineering phases
This will be sorted into building structural, racking, and electrical. Per each the subcontractor will be listed, latest follow ups, phase in engineering and document upload is needed for plans. These contacts must also be stored in a general contact list. 
This code will have the ability to assign a task to a user and send a notification to the user when the task is due.
This program will have the ability to request information from another user and generate a notification for the user that the information is being requested from.  
*** I want to be able to create a section for scheduling. We will talk about this in more detail.

## Pre-Database migration
Data is located in various types of documents: 
(PDFâ€™s, JPEGS, Word Docs, Excel Sheet, etc).
